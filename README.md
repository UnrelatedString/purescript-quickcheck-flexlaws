QuickCheck-powered law tests for PureScript's core typeclasses, but with more flexible integration into your testing framework of choice (like [Spec](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-spec/8.1.1)). Originally forked from the original [`quickcheck-laws`](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-quickcheck-laws) with systematic breaking changes, but now fully rewritten.
