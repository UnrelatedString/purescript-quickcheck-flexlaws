# Contributing to QuickCheck Laws

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `quickcheck-flexlaws`! Unfortunately I haven't written any guidelines here. However, the `contrib` package I forked this from does: Every library in the Contributors organization shares a simple handbook that helps new contributors get started. With that in mind, please consider [reading the short contributing guide on purescript-contrib/governance](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/governance/blob/main/contributing.md) before contributing to this library.
